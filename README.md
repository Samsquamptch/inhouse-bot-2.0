# Inhouse Bot 2.0
A lightweight Dota 2 Inhouse Bot capable of supporting multiple servers simultaneously. <br> 
This project is a continuation of the [Birdhouse Inhouse bot](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/BirdHouse-Inhouse-Bot), 
which itself was intended to be a successor to the [Dota2 EU Ladder Bot](https://github.com/UncleVasya/Dota2-EU-Ladder).

## Key Features
- Improved UI and UX for ease of use
- Simplified setup for less technical server owners
- Manage multiple Discord communities at once
- Improved Dota 2 lobbies, featuring player validation and recorded statistics
- Reduced server permissions required: no more admin access for the bot!

## Setup and User Guide
Instructions on setting up, managing, and using the bot can be found on the [project Wiki](https://github.com/Samsquamptch/inhouse-bot-2.0/wiki)
